Create simple local API server with 2 endpoints:

1.
/api/echo (POST)
- accepts request 
- parse incoming JSON body
- print accepted data to console
- return response with following contents:
						{
						    "characters" : 134,  	      			# number of characters in request body
						    "ip_address" : "185.264.852.64"  			# ip address of request sender
						    "msg_hash"   : "a8f5f167f44f4964e6c998dee827110c" # hash of request body content
						}

2.
/api/status (GET)
- accepts request
- return response with following contents:
						{
						    "timestmp" : "2022-04-01 05:06:59",  # current datetime
						    "rng"      : -48			  # random integer from interval <-100, 68>
						}
						

Use any suitable framework or library of your choice. 
Every request must be authorized/authenticated by API token in request header.
For authentication use token with name "VerySecure" and value "85136c79cbf9fe36bb9d05d0639c70c265c18d37".
